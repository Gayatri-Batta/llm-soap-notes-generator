**S (Subjective):**
The patient, Mr. Tell Harding, reports no known heart problems and has not experienced any specific heart-related symptoms. He mentions occasional shortness of breath when exerting himself, such as when running for the bus, which he believes is normal. He has had annual check-ups with his general practitioner, where his blood pressure has been reported as within the normal range.

**O (Objective):**
Physical examination findings include:
- Normal cardiovascular examination with regular pulse in both hands and wrists.
- Normal blood pressure readings using both stethoscope and automated cuff.
- No abnormalities noted in facial examination, including tongue and neck assessment.
- Abdominal examination shows no tenderness or abnormalities.
- Respiratory examination via auscultation of the back reveals clear and equal air movement in both lungs.
- No abnormalities detected in the feet or pulses.

**A (Assessment):**
Based on the subjective and objective findings, Mr. Harding appears to have no current cardiovascular issues. His occasional shortness of breath during exertion is likely normal and not indicative of a heart problem. The normal blood pressure readings and unremarkable physical examination support this assessment.

**P (Plan):**
1. No immediate cardiovascular interventions are necessary.
2. Continue routine health maintenance and follow-up with primary care physician as scheduled.
3. Educate Mr. Harding on recognizing signs of potential cardiovascular issues and advise him to report any new or worsening symptoms.
4. Encourage regular physical activity within his comfort level to maintain cardiovascular health.
5. Schedule the next follow-up appointment as per routine care guidelines.
